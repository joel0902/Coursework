      <div class="boxed"> <b>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3> </b></div>
       
     <p>I am happy with the tools I have used in Visual Studio Code,  as it helps by having part of the code pop up so it remind you of the different types of code and speeds up the process by automatically filling in when pressing tab or enter. When part of your code is invalid and not recognized it will underline it in red so you know exactly what it is thats wrong. VSC has a debugging console so it can help to break down your code.
    I am also happy with Trello as it helps to keep track of what tasks you are on and what needs doing and what you're in process of doing. It also helps you identify what needs to be completed first by using different colours. Trello is good for working in teams with other people as you set your profile to be viewed and edited by people you invite which would allow projects to be a lot more accessible
    Finally I am happy with Codepen, although its not as advanced as Visual Studio Code something I like about Codepen is that it has an auto update feature, unlike Visual Studio Code where you have to manually type in the command to run the console.
       </p></div>

    <div class="boxed"><b>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3> </b></div>
    <p>I believe the tools that were used in Visual Studio Code were appropriate because it allowed writing code in CSS and HTML5 and very easy on the eye and the software was easy to understand and having the colour codes highlighted helped speed up the project. 

        Trello was brilliant for planning out tasks, which made sure that the project was organized and finished within a deadline. It allowed me to add a colour tag to my tasks, therefore showing how urgent something needed to be done
        
        Codepen was very basic, and the tools it offered were easy and simple to use. Both VSC and Codepen had requirements for my task</p>

 <div class="boxed"> <b>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3> </b></div>

  <p>The strengths of the website are that it is easy to read and navigate which is good because it is a text heavy website, the weaknesses are that it could be more engaging with some images or icons to balance out that it is a very text heavy website. Overall I am still happy with the final result because it is fit for the purpose its meant for which is to provide information, the elements I'm not happy with are minor and this could be further developed by learning JavaScript, using images and icons.</p>

  <div class="boxed"> <b>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3> </b></div>

  <p>I could easily make further improvements to my site by using sites such as w3schools. Learning JavaScript to enhance
    with further features to the page. Javascript can add visual effects to my pages and enhance user interactions in general.
    This could make my end project more eye catching. Aligning the background with the text of my page would also help
    improve my project. 
  </p>

  <div class="boxed"> <b>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3> </b></div>
<p>My web page is simplistic in design, contains all of the required content. The web page is easy to read which is 
  a requirement of any web page page containing alot of text. The ability to get around the website is also made 
  simple with the navigation bar at the top so the user can see the options, also select where they want to 
  navigate to next with ease. It is essential that websites are comfortable easy to read and navigate so they are 
  extremely user friendly to everyone.</p>
