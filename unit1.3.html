    <div class="boxed"><h3><b>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </b></div>
    </h3>
<p>The benefits of the IT tools I were that in Trello I could quickly see which tasks needed to be done and this 
  was kept very organised. A drawback was that I had to stop productivity to update the Trello board. Visual Studio
   Code was very benificial to use as the code is easier to read with the different colours the program uses for 
   key areas of code, the main drawback was that every time something was done in CSS and HTML it had to be done 
   splitscreen which meant saving files individually and then refreshing the webpage manually to check everything 
   was working correctly. Working in a team would have made the process easier as people think very differently
    which brings ideas that an individual developer may not have realised could make a project better, more over
     other benefits of teamwork are i.e discussing layout ideas, theme, researching knowledge to implement on the
      page, also updating Trello would have been more efficient with tasks delegated.

</p>

<div class="boxed"><h3><b>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3> </div>

<p> Efficiency would've been a lot higher if from the start I planned out the exact way I wanted my website to look. 
    This would have given me a design to base my website off and eventually link them together. 
    I spent alot of time thinking about design rather than developing, because I had no clear plan of what 
    the layout for the page would be. The project would have been completed more efficiently if 
    I designed some layout ideas first. I spent a bit of time looking at how other websites are layed 
    out to give me an idea of how I would like mine to be positioned. Tracking a time limit and not spending too little or 
    too much on one particular part also improves efficiency. Taking regular breaks can help improve concentration, 
    while working for a long time without breaks can lead to a steady decline in performance. Committing to a 
    single task before moving onto a next one will increase productivity because attempting to do several tasks 
    at once can result in lost time and productivity.
</p></b>

<div class="boxed"><h3><b>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h3> </div>


<p>In the interest of improving my own productivity next time I would create a drawing of my page layout to make 
    the design process much smoother and clear. Researching by looking at other websites would have been more 
    beneficial to get a good idea of the types of layouts used in successful published websites, or even working 
    as a team to discuss ideas because everyone approaches projects with a different thought process. Slack could
     have been used to discuss ideas whilst working on the projects and to get assistance with the code needed for
      particular features like for example: drop downs, navigation bars as they may already have the knowledge from
       previous projects experience.
 </p>

<br>

<div class="boxed"><h3><b>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h3> </div>

  <p> I would check the functionality of each 
      feature to make sure it is fit for purpose, has maximum compatibility by testing on different devices and
       browsers. Features that work on Chrome or Firefox may not work on Internet Explorer or Opera so to reach the
        maximum amount of users this has to be checked to see if users of different devices or browsers can view 
        the web page correctly without errors, making sure that it is a comfortable viewing experience.
        Usability testing tests the functionality of a website, app or other digital products by observing real users 
        as they attempt to complete tasks on it. This is to reveal areas of confusion and improve overall performance
