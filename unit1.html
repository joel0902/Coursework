   <div class="boxed"><h3><b>1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern businesses</h3> </b></div>

   <b><p>Modern technology in business ensures speed and efficiency. This means giving you more access and control 
     over what you want. For starters, IT has a strong purpose for meeting customers needs in businesses as it is 
     necessary for employees to interact quickly and clearly. IT within businesses can allow customers to find 
     answers even after closing hours. 
        It helps efficiency as  IT can help to preserve resources such as time and physical space and you can save 
        time and money by holding meetings over the internet instead of headquarters.
        All businesses are vulnerable to security threats and vandalism as IT can be used to protect financial and
         confidential data. Having passwords and codes will keep projects safe and away from competition. 
        Employees expect employers to provide them with the greatest and latest technology that will assist them with
        their job responsibilities. Technology has no limitations, Businesses across the nation are diverse in needs, 
        culture and education. Advances in technology can help businesses address these differences. With a successful
         technology plan, there is no limit to what can be accomplished by a business.
        Technology keeps people engaged in many different ways. It reduces stress by allowing you to schedule important 
        deadlines and meetings on an electronic calendar. It also gives employees flexibility to perform work functions 
        on your mobile device. </b>

        <div class="boxed"> <h3> <b>1.2 Describing methods,skills, and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully. What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3> </b></div>

        

<p> Communication needs to be on par with each other to ensure the best possible outcome. Tools which manage to-dos and project plans will allow you to set the availability of your resources and this would stop your project from falling apart.
    A thorough amount of planning should be in place to ensure deadlines are met and to keep the project organised. Planning allows a realistic time scale to be created and that would leave plenty of time for any task slippage to occur. Looking closely at details and listening to opinions is vital to the success of a project. If any problems arrise then its important that communications is involved to prevent any problems to occur. This also includes knowing when to say no as a project team should not promise things they can't deliver and cause a state of panic. Saying no in the beginning could save a lot of problems to occur later. Tools such as draggable timelines would help with organisation.
    Risk Management allows you to produce a risk log of the problems the project could face. If then something was to go wrong then the team can quickly resolve the issue and this will give the team confidence when facing project risks and help clients feel comfortable about the projects progression. Tools like having a central database of project information is necessary to ensure you don't lose momentum during the project and will get team members up to speed.
    Using relevant software important, learning from previous experience on projects can help by not making a time consuming costly mistake again. Making sure you have the tools and resources to do research to complete your project i.e search engines and specialist websites and books when searching for knowledge

<div class="boxed">  <h3> <b>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT  eg making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board</h3> </b></div>

    <p>In order to plan my project I will use Trello, this will involve me creating a board with a simple to-do list.
       This will help me to keep a track on what needs doing, whats in progress and whats completed. I will create a 
       list of all sources and tools involved for the task and how they have been used.A Trello board helped me 
       with lists, filled with cards for organisation It's a lot more than that, though. Trello has 
       everything you need to organize projects of any size. Open a card and you can add comments, upload file 
       attachments, create checklists, add labels and due dates.

<div class="boxed"> <h3> <b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3> </b></div>


        <p>Communication  can cause a project to fail. Using a programme such as Trello, Slack or an email would help to prevent failure <br>

            Time - 	Time is needed to make sure the project is completed within the allotted time <br>

            Change of requirement - A competitive market can lead to a quick change of vision and because of this clients may sometimes change their vision of how their product or certain features in it should look like.
            <br>
            Unforeseen circumstances - If someone was to get sick for example it may delay the project for a certain amount of time or it could even derail it.
             <br>
            Neglecting design could save time and money but since design plays a crucial aspect about developement this could lead projects to fail
            <br>
            Technical risks should as systems failing or budget cuts could force you into a situation where you need to satisfy a clients requirements while being low on resources
            <br>
            Unavoidable risks such as government policy changes or technologies being discontinued </p>

        <div class="boxed">   <h3> <b>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software -  how do you select the right kind of technology for the job.</h3> </b></div>

<p>Choosing what you want the software to do is the first point. You need to know what you want the system to do, what problems it should solve, and what the solution would be worth. 
    Creating a list of software requirements can help you to become a little more specific e.g ease of use, technological preferences, budget requirements, reporting requirements, vendor requirement. Eventually narrowing them down into "fundamental" and "nice to have"
    A software comparison site could help you to compare what they offer and how it fits into your needs.
    You need to think about your companies vision, which will involve trialling and 	testing demos of software and systems. Once you have conducted some research, identify a list of potential software and systems. Ask for a demonstration of how some company's solution addresses all your requirements. Narrow down your list by focusing on products that have impressed you.

    <div class="boxed"><h3><b>1.6 Describe and provide anaylsis of how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes -  how has trello helped your plan and how can git and github help with your codes verson control</h3> </b></div>


 <p>Trello has helped me organise my tasks and keep track of where im up to and what needs to be completed. 
   It helps keep me updated on what time I have for each individual job and reach my ultimate goal which is 
   completion of the project. Github can host my source code project in a variety of different programming 
  languages and will also keep track for me of the various changes made to every iteration. </p>

  <div class="boxed"><h3> <b>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - how does GDPR impact digital projects </h3> </b></div>


<p> GDPR impacts digital projects such as website creation as the regulations are stricter in regards to how personal details are collected and used like sensitive information that can be use to identify someone, This applys to anyones personal or sensitive data and how it is used can be a breach of GDPR regulations, explicit permission must be gained from the owner of the information. You can't just use someones personal information for your website or collect online identifiers (i.e someones device MAC address, IP or User account ID's)
    A user is entitled to "privacy by demand" which means if they give consent (opt-in) you can user their data for the goal they gave permission on and they will always be able to withdraw their consent meaning ALL data collected from this user from the data must be removed.
